    <h1>Pizza Recipe</h1>

    <p>The pizza emerges from the oven with a perfectly crisp, golden crust, slightly charred at the edges for that
        authentic wood-fired flavor. A rich tomato sauce, bursting with tangy sweetness, spreads evenly beneath a layer
        of bubbling, melted mozzarella that stretches with every bite. The toppings—whether savory slices of pepperoni,
        earthy mushrooms, or vibrant bell peppers—meld together, releasing their irresistible aromas.</p>
    <p>A drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of fresh basil add a final touch of freshness, balancing the richness of
        the cheese and sauce. Each bite is a perfect harmony of textures and flavors—crispy, chewy, gooey, and bursting
        with deliciousness.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Making the Pizza Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Proof the yeast:</h4>
            <p>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm
                water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</p>
            <p>After 5 minutes, stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom,
                indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</p>
            <p><em>Note:</em> If you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast," no proofing is required. Just
                add
                it to the flour in the next step.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Make and knead the pizza dough:</h4>
            <p>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil to the bowl. Using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low
                speed
                for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.</p>
            <p>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook for about 7-10 minutes.</p>
            <p>If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.</p>
            <p>The dough should be a little sticky or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more
                flour.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Let the dough rise:</h4>
            <p>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and
                turn
                it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</p>
            <p>At this point, you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quick rise:</strong> Place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Medium rise:</strong> Leave it at room temperature for 8 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow rise:</strong> Refrigerate for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours) for more complex
                    flavors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The longer the rise (to a point), the better the flavor the crust will have.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Preparing the Pizzas</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Preheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet):</h4>
            <p>Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30
                minutes, preferably an hour.</p>
            <p>If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that
                will not warp at high temperatures.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Divide the dough into 2 balls:</h4>
            <p>Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it
                deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half.</p>
            <p>Form 2 round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic, and let sit for 15 minutes
                (or up to 2 hours).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Prep the toppings:</h4>
            <p>Prepare your desired toppings. Avoid overloading the pizza with too many toppings, as this will prevent
                the crust from becoming crisp.</p>
            <p>About a third of a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese is sufficient for one pizza. One to two thinly
                sliced mushrooms will cover a pizza.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Flatten the dough ball and stretch it into a round:</h4>
            <p>Work with one ball of dough at a time. Flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured surface.</p>
            <p>Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick.
                Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.</p>
            <p>Let the dough relax for 5 minutes, then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter—10
                to 12 inches.</p>
            <p>Treat the dough gently! You can also hold up the edges and let the dough hang and stretch while working
                around the edges.</p>
            <p>If a hole appears, place the dough on a floured surface and press it back together to seal.</p>
            <p>Use your palm to flatten the thicker edges and pinch the edges if you want to form a lip.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Brush the dough top with olive oil:</h4>
            <p>Use your fingertips to press down and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling.</p>
            <p>Brush the top of the dough with olive oil to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings. Let rest
                another 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
            <p>Repeat with the second ball of dough.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Sprinkle the pizza peel with cornmeal and place flattened dough on top:</h4>
            <p>Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with cornmeal. The cornmeal acts as little ball
                bearings to help move the pizza from the peel into the oven.</p>
            <p>Transfer one prepared flattened dough to the pizza peel.</p>
            <p>If the dough has lost its shape during the transfer, lightly shape it to the desired dimensions.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings:</h4>
            <p>Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and add your desired toppings.</p>
            <p>Be careful not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Slide pizza into the oven:</h4>
            <p>Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (be careful, the oven is hot!).</p>
            <p>Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide. If not, gently lift the edges of the pizza
                and add a bit more cornmeal.</p>
            <p>Slide the pizza off of the peel and onto the baking stone in the oven.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Bake:</h4>
            <p>Bake the pizza in the 475°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden,
                about 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
            <p>If desired, sprinkle a little more cheese on top toward the end of the cooking time.</p>
        </li>
