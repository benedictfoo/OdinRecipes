        <h1>Banana Ice Cream Recipe</h1>
        <img class="header-img" width="750" height="500" src="../images/ice-cream.webp" alt="banana ice cream">
        <p>This homemade banana ice cream is a creamy, naturally sweet treat made with just three simple ingredients.
            Frozen
            bananas blend into a silky, soft-serve consistency, while a splash of vanilla extract enhances their natural
            sweetness. A small amount of milk helps achieve the perfect texture, making it easy to scoop and enjoy.</p>
        <p>This guilt-free dessert is not only delicious but also dairy-free and refined sugar-free, making it a healthy
            alternative to traditional ice cream. You can customize it with mix-ins like chocolate chips, peanut butter,
            or
            cinnamon for extra flavor. Enjoy it fresh or freeze it for a firmer, scoopable consistency!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large bananas, sliced and frozen (about 4 cups slices)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons plain milk, either dairy or non-dairy</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Freeze the bananas:</h4>
                    <p>24 hours before serving, peel and slice the bananas thinly (about 1/4 inch thick) and spread them
                        on
                        a
                        parchment-lined pan. Freeze until solid. If not using that day, transfer to a zip-top bag.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Make the nice cream:</h4>
                    <h5>Blender method:</h5>
                    <p>Pour the milk and vanilla into the blender container, then add the frozen banana slices. Remove
                        the
                        plug
                        from the blender lid and secure the lid, then insert the tamper (if you have one). Hold the lid
                        on
                        and
                        blend, starting on low speed and increasing to high. Scrape down and repeat as needed to make a
                        smooth
                        puree.</p>

                    <h5>Food processor method:</h5>
                    <p>Place the frozen sliced bananas in a food processor bowl and process, breaking down the banana
                        into
                        small
                        bits. Scrape down the sides, add the vanilla and almond milk, and process until smooth, stopping
                        to
                        scrape down to make sure all the bits are incorporated.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Serve:</h4>
                    <p>As soon as there are no lumps, transfer to bowls to serve, or to a storage tub and freeze. If the
                        puree
                        is softer than you'd like, freeze for 30 minutes to 1 hour, and stir.</p>
                    <p>If you freeze the nice cream until solid, let it stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1
                        hour
                        to
                        soften before serving.</p>
