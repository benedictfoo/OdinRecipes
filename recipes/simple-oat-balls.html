            <h1>Simple Oat Balls Recipe</h1>
            <img width="100%" src="../images/simple-oat-balls.jpg" alt="simple oat balls">
            <p>These no-bake energy bites are a perfect balance of chewy, nutty, and slightly sweet flavors, making them
                a
                delicious and nutritious snack. The combination of rolled oats and almond or peanut butter creates a
                rich,
                hearty base, while a touch of maple syrup or honey adds just the right amount of natural sweetness.
                Almond
                flour
                or ground flaxseed enhances the texture and provides an extra boost of fiber and healthy fats, making
                these
                bites both satisfying and wholesome.</p>
            <p>With endless customization options, you can mix in mini chocolate chips, dried fruit, or even colorful
                sprinkles
                for a fun twist. A pinch of kosher salt ties everything together, enhancing the flavors and adding a
                slight
                contrast to the sweetness. Whether enjoyed as a quick breakfast, post-workout snack, or midday treat,
                these
                energy bites are easy to make and even easier to love.</p>

            <h2>For 12 balls, youâ€™ll need:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup (4 ounces) rolled oats</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (7 ounces) creamy peanut or almond butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (2.4 ounces) almond flour or ground flax seed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons (1 ounce) maple syrup or honey</li>
                <li>1/2 cup small mix-ins like mini chocolate chips, dried fruit, or sprinkles</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>In a medium bowl, combine the oats, nut butter, almond flour or flax, maple syrup or honey, your
                        mix-ins
                        of choice, and salt. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to combine well. You can switch to clean
                        hands and
                        knead the mixture together if it gets too hard to mix.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use a spoon or cookie scoop to portion the dough into 12 balls about the size of a ping ping
                        ball. Roll
                        to form a solid ball. You can portion these directly into a flat storage container with a lid or
                        onto a
                        parchment-lined baking sheet.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Chill for 1 hour to firm and then move to an airtight container for longer-term storage. These
                        energy
                        balls can be kept in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage,
                        freeze
                        solid on a baking sheet and then move to a zip-top bag for up to 2 months. Serve frozen or thaw
                        in the
                        fridge first.</p>
